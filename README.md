# Clue Weather for MCPi/Kodi

**Clue Weather** package is designed to become the system configurator tool for Clue MCPi
media player ( Kodi fork for Raspberry Pi) - and for the entire Clue system. **Clue Plugin** 
provides a dedicated GUI environment developed over MCPi in order to allow end-user to 
set-up the system services and components in a graphical manner. This plugin should 
work also on Kodi v15 and it will work 100% if is running on RPi devices and if some 
other Clue packages are already installed.
